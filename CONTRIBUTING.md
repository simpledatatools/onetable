## Contributing to this project

We are so glad you are reading this and you are interested in contributing to OneTable! We hope to build a community of great minds who can help us tackle new technology challenges each day. If you haven't already, please introduce yourself - we'd love to meet you and learn more about your background. We want you working on things you're excited about, and hope we can build opportunities for that through work with OneTable.

**Casual Contributors**

A list of current issues are always updated on this repository. You are welcome to help solve an issue that is not currently assigned to another person and is marked as 'Open'. If you are interested in solving an issue, please reach out and we will assign the issue to you so others know you are working on it.

We follow a simple, but strict process for git branches and contributing:

- Each issue will be a small task (usually requiring 8 hours or much less), and will include a description with details. Mockups and videos will be provided in cases where the intended functionality or bug fixes cannot be described without a visual example.

- You will only be assigned one issue at a time. You should complete the current issue that is assigned to you, then follow up for your next task if you are interested in working on another issue. If you need help with an issue, please reach out to @locAtLaheriyam, who is happy to assist you with any challenge.

- You should always work on a git branch that is the same name / number as the issue you are assigned using the format `issue-[Issue Number]` (i.e. branch `issue-300` would be the branch for when you are working on issue-300).

- If you have not completed the task, you can still push your code to the repository, as we consider all branches to be not complete unless you open a pull request. Once you have completed your task, you should open up a PR that requests to merge your issue branch into branch `dev` and assign the PR to Matt and Loc (usernames: @mattcapelli and @locAtLaheriyam) as the reviewers. We will merge the code into the main codebase once we have reviewed, or if there are changes needed, we will add feedback to the github issue for you to fix.


**Full-time contributors**

We also have opportunities for you to work on this project in a paid position (as a full / part time job) if you are able to lead large portions of the development and can work regular hours. We are a team that is scattered across the globe in almost every timezone and we are happy to have you work any schedule that is best for you. If you are available to contribute to the project in this way, please reach out. The setup works as:

- We would like someone who works consistent hours each day. This helps us to more easily coordinate tasks, ensure upcoming tasks are prepared in advance, make sure code is reviewed in a timely manner, and to make sure we can track and monitor your progress.

- People on our team are working between London (GMT+0) and Indochina Time (GMT+7), but this opportunity is open to any one in any timezone.

- We are looking for someone to work for at least 5 hours per day, but you can work as many hours as you choose so long as it is consistent hours and you are producing code at a pace and quality to our standards.

- You can choose the hours you prefer to work, but they should be the same hours each each day (i.e. always working 10am - 3pm IST each day Monday - Friday).

- You must work through the platform Upwork, which allows us to transfer salaries easily to multiple countries, unless you are based in the United States. 

- At your start time each day, you must check in with Matt (@mattcapelli) for a virtual daily standup meeting to discuss what you are working on, your plans for the day, and the goals of what you plan to complete. During this time, please also ask any questions or clarifications you have.

- At the end of each day, you provide an quick update with Matt through another virtual standup, including a summary of what you completed during the day as well as any questions or requests that came up while you were working. If you have questions about the project’s requirements, need mockups created, or have other clarifications, these should be provided at the end of each day so that we can get you answers before the next day begins.

- You will be expected to push your code to our git repository at the end of every day using the git branch process we have described above.

- The work must be completed by you, and cannot be sent to others or subcontracted to other developers.

Please see our contribution guidelines, community guidelines, and code standards for more detail. 

## Choosing and using libraries

If you would like to use a library as part of the codebase you contribute, please make sure the library is approved beforehand by @locAtLaheriyam. In general, we only use libraries that are MIT licensed and well supported.

## Not a developer but interested in getting involved?

Fantastic! If you are interested in contributing to the project but you are not a developer, please do reach out. There are a huge amount of other tasks that support the project - from developing mockups or helping to develop the technology roadmap, to connecting with new organizations who can give feedback and test out new features. Please reach out to @mattcapelli and we will schedule a call to get you involved.
